# Boorumitu

Danbooru client for Android and (hopefully) iOS.

## Development

I'm not using expo this time so setting up the dev environment is sadly rather time consuming. I'll outline the steps necessary here:

* [Follow this guide for OS specific instructions.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

* Clone this repo.

* Run `npm install` in the root of the repo.

* [Connect you phone via USB](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device) or open an emulator.

* Run `npm start` and then `npm run android` in separate terminal windows.
